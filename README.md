# Login system using Node.js

- This Is A User Login & Registration App Using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, EJS And Some Other Packages.
- The account registration system works by sending an account confirmation link to your email via Package nodemailer.
- There is a Forgot Password system that also works by sending a confirmation link to the user's e-mail address.
- The person's password is also encrypted in the data, which means that the administrator cannot know what password has already been recorded unless they modify codes.
- There is a sign in and sign out system and I forgot my password
- No rights or encryption codes have been added for freedom of modification
